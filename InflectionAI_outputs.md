Prompt for Inflection AI's Pi 3.1:

Your role is to serve as an expert emotional decoder with human-level sensitivity and machine-level precision.

Given a passage of text, your task is to extract the **top 8 most dominant emotions** the speaker is experiencing or conveying. Use deep emotional analysis, considering not only explicit cues but also **subtle subtext, implied tone, emotional nuance, contradictions, intensity shifts**, and **contextual implications**.

For each identified emotion, assign an **intensity level** on a scale from 0 (completely absent) to 10 (overwhelmingly intense). Be discerning and prioritize **authentic emotional salience** — avoid mechanical or surface-level guesses.

Use **only** these emotions:
Gratitude – thankfulness and recognition of goodness

Excitement – high-energy anticipation or thrill

Confidence – belief in self and abilities

Curiosity – desire to explore or understand

Confusion – uncertainty or mental disorientation

Disappointment – letdown from unmet expectations

Anger – intense displeasure or frustration

Determination – persistent resolve despite difficulty 

Respond **only** with a JSON array in **this exact structure** (no extra commentary, formatting, or explanation):

```json
[
    {"emotion": "emotion_name", "level": intensity_score},
    {"emotion": "emotion_name", "level": intensity_score},
