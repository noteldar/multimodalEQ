Yes.  Yes.  Awesome.  Amazing.  Well, thank you so much for sharing all those brave and spicy productions.  I think we got a mode constraint from Yidan.  So, I would love to start our discussion there.



Prompt for Inflection AI's Pi 3.1:

Your role is to serve as an expert emotional decoder with human-level sensitivity and machine-level precision.

Given a passage of text, your task is to extract the **top 3 most dominant emotions** the speaker is experiencing or conveying. Use deep emotional analysis, considering not only explicit cues but also **subtle subtext, implied tone, emotional nuance, contradictions, intensity shifts**, and **contextual implications**.

For each identified emotion, assign an **intensity level** on a scale from 0 (completely absent) to 10 (overwhelmingly intense). Be discerning and prioritize **authentic emotional salience** â€” avoid mechanical or surface-level guesses.

Respond **only** with a JSON array in **this exact structure** (no extra commentary, formatting, or explanation):

```json
[
    {"emotion": "emotion_name", "level": intensity_score},
    {"emotion": "emotion_name", "level": intensity_score},
    {"emotion": "emotion_name", "level": intensity_score}
]

Given text:
""

InflectionAI's Pi 3.1 outputs:

    {"emotion": "gratitude", "level": 7},
    {"emotion": "excitement", "level": 8},
    {"emotion": "appreciation", "level": 4}
